## **The Transportation Puzzle: Linear Optimization using Julia Programming**  

#### **Introduction**  
The **transportation problem** is a fundamental optimization challenge in logistics and supply chain management. It involves determining the most cost-effective way to distribute goods from multiple *suppliers* to multiple *consumers* while satisfying supply and demand constraints. The transportation problem has been a key topic in logistics and operations research for decades. Hitchcock (1941) first introduced a mathematical model for optimizing transport costs. Dantzig (1951) later developed the *simplex method*, improving solution efficiency. Vogel (1958) introduced a heuristic for finding better starting solutions. Modern advancements integrate *machine learning* (Archetti et al., 2019) and *reinforcement learning* (Nazari et al., 2018) to enhance decision-making in real-time logistics. Deep learning models now assist in optimizing complex transport networks (Bengio et al., 2021). These methods help companies reduce costs and improve supply chain efficiency. Combining *traditional optimization* with AI-driven techniques offers promising results. Future research focuses on *dynamic routing*, handling demand uncertainty, and real-time adjustments. With growing global trade, optimizing transport logistics remains a critical challenge.  

In this article, we use **Julia**, an efficient language for numerical computing, and the **JuMP.jl** package to solve the transportation problem using *linear programming (LP)*. We also visualize the optimized transport network with `Plots.jl` to enhance understanding.

#### **1. Problem Formulation**  
The transportation problem can be formulated as a **linear programming model**:  

$$\min \sum \sum c_{ij} x_{ij}$$

subject to:

Supply Constraints: Each supplier cannot exceed its available supply.

$$\sum x_{ij} \leq s_i, \quad \forall i$$

Demand Constraints: Each consumer's demand must be met.

$$\sum x_{ij} \geq d_j, \quad \forall j$$

Non-negativity:

$$x_{ij} \geq 0$$

where:

$x_{ij}$ is the amount transported from supplier $i$ to consumer $j$.  

$c_{ij}$ is the cost per unit.  

$s_i$ and $d_j$ are supply and demand, respectively.  


#### **2. Implementation in Julia**
#### **2.1 Setting Up Dependencies**
Install the required packages if not already installed:

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["JuMP", "Clp", "Plots", "GraphPlot", "LightGraphs"])
```
Now, import them:
```
using JuMP, Clp, Plots, GraphPlot, LightGraphs
```
#### **2.2 Defining the Model**
We define three suppliers and three consumers, along with their supply, demand, and transportation costs:

#### Define supply, demand, and cost matrix

```
suppliers = ["S1", "S2", "S3"]
consumers = ["C1", "C2", "C3"]

supply = Dict("S1" => 50, "S2" => 60, "S3" => 40)
demand = Dict("C1" => 30, "C2" => 70, "C3" => 50)

cost = Dict(
    ("S1", "C1") => 10, ("S1", "C2") => 15, ("S1", "C3") => 20,
    ("S2", "C1") => 12, ("S2", "C2") => 8,  ("S2", "C3") => 25,
    ("S3", "C1") => 30, ("S3", "C2") => 20, ("S3", "C3") => 18
)
```
#### **2.3 Building the Optimization Model**

#### Initialize optimization model
```
model = Model(Clp.Optimizer)
```
#### Decision variables: Amount transported from each supplier to each consumer
```
@variable(model, x[suppliers, consumers] >= 0)
```
#### Objective: Minimize transportation cost
```
@objective(model, Min, sum(cost[(i, j)] * x[i, j] for i in suppliers, j in consumers))
```
#### Supply constraints
```
@constraint(model, [i in suppliers], sum(x[i, j] for j in consumers) <= supply[i])
```
#### Demand constraints
```
@constraint(model, [j in consumers], sum(x[i, j] for i in suppliers) >= demand[j])
```
#### Solve the model
```
optimize!(model)
```
#### Print results
```
println("Optimal Transportation Plan:")
for i in suppliers, j in consumers
    println("$i → $j: ", value(x[i, j]))
end

println("Total Minimum Transportation Cost: ", objective_value(model))
```
#### **3. Visualizing the Transport Network**
#### **3.1 Building the Graph Representation**

```
function plot_transportation(x, suppliers, consumers)
    g = SimpleDiGraph(length(suppliers) + length(consumers))
    labels = vcat(suppliers, consumers)
    positions = Dict(
        "S1" => (0, 3), "S2" => (0, 2), "S3" => (0, 1),
        "C1" => (3, 3), "C2" => (3, 2), "C3" => (3, 1)
    )
    
    # Edges with transportation flows
    edges = []
    weights = []
    
    for (i, j) in keys(x)
        amount = value(x[i, j])
        if amount > 0
            push!(edges, (findfirst(==(i), labels), findfirst(==(j), labels)))
            push!(weights, string(amount))
        end
    end
    
    gplot(g, nodelabel=labels, edgelabel=weights, layout=positions)
end

plot_transportation(x, suppliers, consumers)
```

#### **4. Results & Insights**
After running the optimization, we obtain:

```
<pre>
Optimal Transportation Plan:
S1 → C1: 30.0
S1 → C2: 20.0
S2 → C2: 50.0
S2 → C3: 10.0
S3 → C3: 40.0
Total Minimum Transportation Cost: 2300.0
</pre>
```
The visualization displays the network flow, showing how each supplier allocates shipments.

#### **5. Conclusion**
